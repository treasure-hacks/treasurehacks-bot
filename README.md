# Treasure Hacks Discord Bot

This starts a Discord bot using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

## Running Locally
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Add `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DETA_PROJECT_KEY` to `.ENV` file
- Run development bot `npm run dev`

## üìù Notes

- Upon the first run of the starter, it can take up to an hour for your slash commands to be visible in the Discord Client.
- To create a new command, just create a file in the `commands` directory. You can take a look at the `template.js` file for an example of what commands should look like. For any additional help see the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide).
